# Project specific info

__NOTE: This app uses 2 different navigators (Web + Native) right now because of conflicting versions of `native-base@0.34.9` and `react-native-web@0.18.x`__
A fix was announced by GeekyAnts [(GitHub issue)](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase/issues/5075), however, we do not know when.
