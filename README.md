# Project specific info

__NOTE: This app uses 2 different navigators (Web + Native) right now because of conflicting versions of `native-base@0.34.9` and `react-native-web@0.18.x`__
A fix was announced by GeekyAnts [(GitHub issue)](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase/issues/5075), however, we do not know when.

__NOTE: Due to version conflicts with `@miblanchard/react-native-slider` packages have to be installed with `--force` or `--legacy-peer-deps` in npm__
